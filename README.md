#### OVERVIEW
Player Meets Hangman originally had the fundemental idea that when two people match, they'll play a game of Hangman. One person asks the other person something in order to get to know the other person, the person asked will write an answer with some letters given (like how Hangman is played typically). If the person guessing guesses correctly, that person will receive the person's phone number, social media, or email.

This was originally the idea but due to the extremely difficult implimentation of the Person-to-Person code with Hangman integration, we had to scrap the idea to one that is feasible to make. We chose to make a simple and fun dating app that incorporates Hangman on the side. This app has features such as displaying a personâ€™s profile and information on a feed, knowing whether a user is interested in another user, swiping right/left, and uploading photos.
