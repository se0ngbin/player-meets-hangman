#### OVERVIEW
Player Meets Hangman is a dating app that incorporates minigames (hangman) to match users to one another. The app will display a personâ€™s profile and information on a feed. If a user is interested in another, then the user can choose to swipe right/left. In the case both people swipe right, a game will appear. The number of lives the users get is based on how many similarities (answers to make or break questions) users have with each other. If the users beat the game, then they will obtain each other's contact information.
